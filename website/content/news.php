    In July our featured speaker will be
    <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/jem-rayfield/27/b19/757" target="speaker">Jem Rayfield</a>,
    Lead Technical Architect of Future Media and Technology
    at the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk" target="bbc">BBC</a>.
    Jem has been leading a major MarkLogic-based project at the
    Beeb that will process all the information, in real time, for the upcoming
    <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/2012/" target="bbc">2012 Olympic Games in London</a>.
    We're very lucky that Jem has agreed to take time out from what must be an
    intense schedule to stop by and talk to us.

    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p class="homepagetext">
        In this talk, Jem describes the latest developments in the transformational
        technology strategy the BBC Future Media &amp; Technology department is using to
        evolve from a relational content model and static publishing framework to a
        fully Dynamic Semantic Publishing (DSP) architecture. This approach uses
        XML/XQuery and linked data technology to automate the aggregation,
        publishing and re-purposing of interrelated content objects according to an
        ontological domain-modelled information architecture, providing a greatly
        improved user experience and high levels of user engagement.   The BBC's
        <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/default.stm" target="bbc">World Cup</a>
        web site was the first showcase of DSP, and probably the first
        major implementation of semantic web technologies on a commercial media
        site. In 2012, the BBC will launch two new sites based on DSP:
        <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/2012/" target="bbc">The 2012 Olympics</a>
        and a completely redesigned
        <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/" target="bbc">BBC Sports</a> site.
