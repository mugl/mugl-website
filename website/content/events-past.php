    <div class="floatpicture"><img src="images/jeni_tennison.jpg" width="112" height="113" alt="Jeni Tennison" title="Jeni Tennison"/></div>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        On May 22 we were honored to have
        <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/" target="speaker">Dr. Jeni Tennison</a>
        as our featured guest.  While in Prague I was able to convince Dr. Tennison
        (who gave the keynote at <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz">XML Prague 2012</a>)
        to speak at the MUGL.  Jeni doesn't do many events like this so
        we're doubly lucky that she agreed visit us.
    </p>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        Dr. Tennison's interests are far ranging and tend toward the academic,
        but she is perhaps best known for writing three XSLT books:
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593243" title="Beginning XSLT 2.0" alt="Beginning XSLT 2.0" target="book"><i>Beginning XSLT 2.0</i></a>,
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861005946" title="Beginning XSLT" alt="Beginning XSLT" target="book"><i>Beginning XSLT</i></a> and
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764547763" title="XSLT and XPath On The Edge" alt="XSLT and XPath On The Edge" target="book"><i>XSLT and XPath On The Edge</i></a>.
    </p>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        Topic of her talk was: "I can talk about
        <a href="http://legislation.gov.uk/" target="misc">legislation.gov.uk</a> and how we're using
        MarkLogic within it, and *not* using ML for some of the new features that we're supporting."
    </p>
    <p class="homepagetext">
        Everyone agreed this was one of the best presentation in the MUGL's history.

    <div class="floatpicture"><img src="images/adamretter.jpg" width="91" height="124" alt="Adam Retter" title="Adam Retter"/></div>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        In March we had
        <a href="http://www.adamretter.org.uk/" target="speaker">Adam Retter</a>,
        speaking about <i>RESTful XQuery</i>, using XQuery 3.0 annotations
        in  XQuery in a manner similar to the way JAX-RS annotations are used in Java.
        Adam also presented this topic at
        <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz">XML Prague</a> in February. Adam is a long-time XQuery
        fanatic and has been a key contributor to the eXist XML database
        and W3C standards.
    </p>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        We also had <a href="http://www.cfoster.net/" target="speaker">Charles Foster</a>,
        speaking about the subject of his XML Prague talk
        <i>Building Bridges from Java to XQuery</i> which is about his modifications
        to XQJ for invoking XQuery functions from Java.  Charles is a MUGL regular
        and is a long-time MarkLogic user.
    </p>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        The papers that Adam and Charles submitted to XML Prague, along with
        all the others, can be found online here:

    </p>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        There was also  an informal report on the
        <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz/2012/index.html" title="XML Prague" target="speaker">XML Prague 2012</a>
        conference, held Feb 10-12.  Several MUGL members
        were there (three were speakers), and two others who spoke
        there have also been MUGL speakers.  Yet another, who will be
        our MUGL speaker in May, gave the keynote.

        On Thursday, November 19, 2011 we had a very interesting presentation
        by <a href="http://webcomposite.com/" target="kay">James Fuller</a>
        of MarkLogic.  Jim is an XQuery innovator and spoke about
        being more productive with
        <i>XQuery - The GSD Language</i>.  If you've never heard of the MarkLogic
        term "GSD", it's like Getting Things Done, but a bit ruder.
    </p>

        The slides for Jim's presentation from the GoTo Conference are available on

	</p>

	<p class="homepagetext">
	Dr. Kay gave us a very interesting introduction to his Saxon-in-the-browser
	XSLT 2.0 processor that's implemented with JavaScript and GWT.  If you missed
	this talk you've missed one of the great innovators of the XML world.

	<h2>September 15, 2011: Norm Walsh, REST Easy With MarkLogic</h2>
	<div class="floatpicture"><img src="images/norm.gif"/></div>

	<p class="homepagetext">
	On September 15, 2011.
	<a href="http://norman.walsh.name/" target="norm">Norm Walsh</a>,
	MarkLogic Lead Engineer, XML/XQuery/DocBook/XProc maven and well known
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8SNp_cQfrA" target="youtube">tall guy</a> was
	our guest at the September MUGL meeting.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
	Norm stopped off on his way to XML Summer School in Oxford to
	give us a very interesting talk about doing REST natively on
	MarkLogic.  This was "Norm's half" of a talk that Norm and I
	presented jointly at the MarkLogic User Conference in
	San Francisco in May, 2011.
	</p>

	<p class="homepagetext">
		My <a href="http://prezi.com/jlkpxfja7dda/mugl-september-2011-norm-walsh/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>
		for this presentation has the usual overview of MarkLogic
		and some amusing photos of Norman Walsh(es).

	<h2>August 17, 2011: Stephen Buxton, A Sneak Peak at MarkLogic 5.0</h2>

	<p class="homepagetext">
		Stephen Buxton, Director of Product Management at MarkLogic
		flew in from California and gave us a very well received talk
		about some of the new features that will be in the MarkLogic 5.0
		release, due out in a few months.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		My <a href="http://prezi.com/hfggzze5ad4j/mugl-august-2011-stephen-buxton/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>
		for this presentation gives a similar overview of MarkLogic
		as well as a few photos of Stephen.  Unfortunately, I didn't
		get a copy of Stephen's slides (and he probably wouldn't give
		them to me anyway).
	</p>

	<h2>July 14, 2011: Inaugural MUGL Meeting, John Snelson</h2>

	<p class="homepagetext">
		The very first meeting of the MUGL took place
		on July 14, 2011 at the Skills Matter Exchange.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		By all accounts it was a great success.  We had
		attendance of about 20 people, from a variety of
		companies around London that are using MarkLogic
		in many different ways.  Not bad considering we did
		very little promotion.  We even had a couple of
		senior MarkLogic people from The States drop by
		who were in London for other reasons.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		One of our members, Martin Dransfield, took some
		photos of the event.  Once I get the chance, I will
		upload them here and on the MeetUp site.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		My <a href="http://prezi.com/r-mzgxuw6fim/mugl-july-2011-john-snelson/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>,
		which gave a little background
		on the early days of MarkLogic,
		was apparently quite a hit.  It's Flash-based and
		done with a tool called Prezi.  You can play it
		in your very own browser from the Prezi site,
		just click the link above.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		Please spread the word about the MUGL to your
		friends and associates.  And don't forget to
		<a href="http://www.meetup.com/muglondon/" target="foo">sign up</a>
		if you plan to attend the next meeting.
